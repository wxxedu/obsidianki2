# obsidianki2

This is an [Anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki) plugin that allows you to import your obsidian vault into Anki. It is far from perfect, but it provides a way for you to access your obsidian files in Anki.

## Progress

### TODOs

- [ ] Add support for link back to Obsidian
- [ ] Work on the user interface
- [ ] Work on a user manual

## How to use

As I am busy working on implementing some of the features in this plugin, you may have to figure it out by yourself. Sorry for now:-)
